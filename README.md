## Bus Traveling Console Application

 I have created a console application that allows users to make a reservation for a vacation by bus in different countries. They can
 create an account and then, select the period of the excursion, the destination and other information. The input and the output can be written in both CSV files and the terminal.
 The app is developed in C++ and only has the backend part.
